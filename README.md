# ImmersiveTravel

A work-in-progress mod for Daggerfall Unity that implements Morrowind-like fast travel.

Implemented features: 
- Adds carriage drivers to city gates blocks
- Carriage drivers can be talked to to initiate fast travel
- You can no longer fast travel from anywhere
- You can only fast travel to towns, but no longer to dungeons, temples or farms
- Fast travel now cost 1 gold per day more as payment for the carriage driver
- Beautiful Cities of Daggerfall compatibility (download the patch from BCOD nexus page)
- Basic roads mod integration (the Immersive Travel map can now display the roads from BasicRoads)
- Variable size location dots (similar to the Travel Options map)
- Compatibility with TravelOptions

To-do list:
- Regional variants for carriage drivers (for instance desert regions could have camels instead of horses)
