# ImmersiveTravel

**A work-in-progress mod for Daggerfall Unity that implements Morrowind-like fast travel.**

## Implemented features: 
- Adds carriage drivers outside the gates of every major city. Interact with them to initiate fast travel.
- If you are using World of Daggerfall, the sailors on city docks will also offer fast-travel service (but only to towns with docks)
- You can choose which types of destinations are allowed for fast travel
- You can no longer fast travel from anywhere (can be re-enabled in the mod's settings)
- Fast travel cost can be increased or removed entirely in the mod's settings
- The maps used by carriage drivers and sailors can display the roads from Basic Roads (if it is installed and enabled)

## Compatibility
- Beautiful Cities of Daggerfall compatibility (download the patch from BCOD nexus page)
- Compatibility with major travel-related mods such as TravelOptions and Hidden Map Locations

## Coming soon
- Regional variants for carriage drivers (for instance desert regions could have camels instead of horses)
- Better ship travel
