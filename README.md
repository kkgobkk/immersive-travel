# ImmersiveTravel

**A work-in-progress mod for Daggerfall Unity that implements diegetic (aka Morrowind-like) fast travel.**

## Implemented features: 
- Adds carriage drivers outside the gates of every major city. Interact with them to initiate fast travel.
- If you are using World of Daggerfall, the sailors on the docks will also offer fast-travel service (but only to other locations with docks)
- You can choose which types of destinations are allowed for fast travel
- You can no longer fast travel unless talkiing to the aforementioned coachmen and sailors (can be re-enabled in the mod's settings)
- Fast travel cost can be increased or removed entirely in the mod's settings
- The maps used by carriage drivers and sailors can display roads and tracks from Basic Roads (if it is installed and enabled)

## Compatibility
- The mod is also available for the unofficial Android port of DFU
- Beautiful Cities of Daggerfall is compatible, you need to download the ImmersiveTravel patch from BCOD's nexus page
- IT is compatible with major travel-related mods such as TravelOptions and Hidden Map Locations

## Coming soon
- Regional variants for carriage drivers (for instance desert regions could have camels instead of horses)
- Better / more detailed ship travel
- An option to prevent carriage drivers from taking you across the ocean

## Disclaimer
- This is my first mod (of any game), my first time using Unity, and my first time coding in C#, so feedback and bug reports are especially appreciated.
